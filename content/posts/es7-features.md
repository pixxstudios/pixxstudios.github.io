## Array includes() method

**The old way to check if some value is present inside an array was to use Array's indexOf() method. IndexOf() returned -1 if element is not found or else the position of element if it's present in the array.**

Similar to Math.pow(), the exponential operator \*\* was introduced in ES2016. It returns the first argument raised to the power of second argument.
